description: |
  A raw "object map" servers a similar purpose to a standard "object map" map, but is meant for use when specifying ground truth maps. The objects in the map:
    - have a class label rather than probability distribution),  
    - have a field for denoting an object's unique ID, and
    - can denote if the object is a group
